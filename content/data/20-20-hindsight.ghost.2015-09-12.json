Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1.

If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too.

It introduced the concept of async as a Café and this has stuck with me. The analogy really goes a long way in explaining how async works, but was largely academic in the text. I plan on fleshing this out with concrete examples as well as including other things I have picked up along the way.\n\n## The Menu\n* Introducing the Kitchen\n* Kettles vs Carrots\n* The many chefs\n* The attentive waiter\n* Cancelling orders\n\n\n## Introducing the Kitchen\nIn this intro I am going to dive right in and show you the differences between synchronous and asynchronous execution in C#. I will be expanding on a number of the topics as we go along, but if you feel I have missed or glossed over something please let me know in the comments. \n\n#### Mise en place\nThe async and await keywords were introduced in C# 5.0 which shipped with .NET 4.5. To get started you are going to need to prepare the following:\n\n* Visual Studio 2013 ([Express Version](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_2) is free if you don't have it)\n * Installing ([.NET 4.5+]()) on top of VS2012 will work too.\n* Source from [Github](https://github.com/chrisfraser/AsyncKitchenIntro)\n\n#### Sales pitch\nIf you are reading this because you are motivating to use C# 5.0 async and await in a new project, I am going to tl;dr this and make your life easy. Take a deep breath.\n\n> Async allows you to have fast, fluid and responsive UI in your client or greater throughput on your web server with the same resources, while maintaining a code structure and paradigm very similar to that of synchronous code. \n\nEverything, down to your cellphone, has multiple cores these days. There is no longer any excuse for not using async to take advantage of the current hardware architecture. With a little help from our two chefs I am going to show you how this works.\n\n#### The kitchen\nThis kitchen is unreasonable and makes a single dish: Tea and baked carrots. Trust me, it is delicious.\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n* The chef has to make tea\n* The chef has to make baked carrots\n* After making both he can serve them\n\n#### The synchronous chef\nThe synchronous chef is a single minded bloke. Methodical is his mantra. He starts off making tea which requires some boiling water. So he turns on the kettle, and watches it while it boils, then makes the tea. He then chops the carrots and puts them in the oven to bake and serves it all when the carrots are perfectly done.\n\n```language-csharp\npublic class Chef\n{\n    public string MakeTeaAndCarrots()\n    {\n        string tea = MakeTea();\n        string bakedCarrots = MakeBakeCarrots();\n\n        string dish = Serve(tea, bakedCarrots);\n\n        return dish;\n    }\n\n    private string MakeTea()\n    {\n        BoilKettle();\n\n        // Making tea\n        Thread.Sleep(500);\n\n        return \"tea\";\n    }\n\n    private void BoilKettle()\n    {\n        // Boiling kettle\n        Thread.Sleep(1000);\n    }\n\n    private string MakeBakeCarrots()\n    {\n        ChopCarrots();\n\n        // Baking carrots\n        Thread.Sleep(1500);\n\n        return \"baked carrots\";\n    }\n\n    private void ChopCarrots()\n    {\n        // Chopping carrots\n        Thread.Sleep(500);\n    }\n\n    private string Serve(string tea, string bakedCarrots)\n    {\n        Thread.Sleep(500);\n\n        return String.Format(\"Cold {0} and tasty {1}\", tea, bakedCarrots);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere is the output of the GitHub code on my machine. It has some extra logging and timing in it so we can see how long things took to happen.\n\n![Sync chef output](/content/images/2014/Jul/Sync-chef-output.png#left)\n\nThis gets the job done, but customers are complaining about slow service and cold tea. It also does not feel like the way I would do this in my kitchen. Let's see if the asynchronous chef does any better.\n\n#### The asynchronous chef\nThe asynchronous chef is all about getting the job done as efficiently as possible. He does things a little differently. He starts off making tea which requires some boiling water. So he turns on the kettle, then immediately starts to chop the carrots. When the carrots are chopped he puts them in the oven. When the kettle has boiled he makes the tea. Then he serves it all when the carrots are perfectly done.\n\n```language-csharp\npublic class AsyncChef\n{\n    public async Task<string> MakeTeaAndCarrotsAsync()\n    {\n        Task<string> makeTea = MakeTea();\n        Task<string> bakeCarrots = MakeBakedCarrots();\n\n        string dish = Serve(await makeTea, await bakeCarrots);\n\n        return dish;\n    }\n\n    private async Task<string> MakeTea()\n    {\n        await BoilKettle();\n\n        // Making tea\n        Thread.Sleep(500);\n\n        return \"tea\";\n    }\n\n    private async Task BoilKettle()\n    {\n        // Boiling kettle\n        await Task.Delay(1000);\n    }\n\n    private async Task<string> MakeBakedCarrots()\n    {\n        ChopCarrots();\n\n        // Baking carrots\n        await Task.Delay(1500);\n\n        return \"baked carrots\";\n    }\n\n    private void ChopCarrots()\n    {\n        // Chopping carrots\n        Thread.Sleep(500);\n    }\n\n    private string Serve(string tea, string bakedCarrots)\n    {\n        // Serving\n        Thread.Sleep(500);\n\n        return String.Format(\"Hot {0} and tasty {1}\", tea, bakedCarrots);\n    }\n}\n```\nHere is the output.\n\n![Async chef output](/content/images/2014/Jul/Async-chef-output.png#left)\n\nThis is a lot better. The customers got their food quicker with hot tea. This also feels a lot more like the way I would make tea and carrots.\n\n#### Discussion\nYou will notice that the code in the two samples is very similar. There are a few extra async and await keywords as well as a Task class in the async version, but it reads very much like the synchronous one. C# 5.0 goes a long way to make it easy to write async code.\n\nIn the AsyncChef you will see `Task.Delay()` substituted for `Thread.Sleep()` when boiling the kettle and baking the carrots. These represent two different types of work in C#. They can be broadly categorized as work you need to do and work you can watch someone else do, if you choose to. Both the kettle and the oven represent work you can watch and need some way of signalling to the chef that they are finished if we want to use them asynchronously. The two types of work, Task class and signalling mechanisms will be dealt with in the next instalment in this series, **Kettles vs Carrots**. If you don't know what a Task is, think of it as a promise to return a result in the future for now.\n\nIf you haven't guessed it already, my two chefs are analogous to a thread. There is a common misconception that async means multi-threaded, but this is not true. The two ideas are complementary, but can happily exist independently. In the above examples there is only one<sup>1</sup> thread executing the code. The difference is that the asynchronous chef is able to continue with other work while the kettle is boiling or oven baking. This is the key to asynchrony, your thread is able to do useful work while waiting on other, long running, work out of its control. When the long running work is finished, there is magic that happens under the covers to ensure that your code resumes on the right thread.\n\n#### What magic is this?\nFirst off, async and await are a C# language feature. The CLR knows nothing about it. This means that everything involved in getting your asynchronous code to look, feel and behave like synchronous code is happening in the compiler. There is no functionality in the CLR to pause and resume a method so this is achieved by creating a state machine. In simple cases the state machine magic is easy to understand, but for more complex examples like nesting or using statements it is truly magical. There is a fantastic [talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDays/Techdays-2014-the-Netherlands/Async-programming-deep-dive) by Bart De Smet explaining how this works in detail.\n\nVery basically your method is chopped up into as many parts as you have await statements, plus one. A state machine tracks which part is to be executed next. Every time an await keyword is hit a continuation is registered to execute the next part of your method when the previous part is complete.\n\nEach time an await expression is hit in your async methods a number of actions are preformed:\n\n1.  A check is done to see if the Task you are awaiting is already complete. \n * If it is complete the method will continue synchronously.\n2.  The current SynchronizationContext is captured.\n3.  Everything required to continue the method is bundled into an object and stored on the heap.\n4.  A continuation is registered on completion of the awaited Task<sup>2</sup> to continue the state machine.\n5.  The tread is released and control is returned to the calling method.\n6.  When the awaited Task is complete the state machine is invoked again to continue the method.\n7.  If the SynchronizationContext captured in 2. is not null it is used to ensure that the continuation is marshalled onto the original thread. If it is null the current task scheduler is used. This is probably the default so the remainder of your method will execute on a thread pool thread.\n8.  The result of the Task is coerced. If it is a Task<T> the await expression will return a result of T if no exceptions were thrown.\n9. If any exceptions were thrown during execution the first will be coerced and re-thrown upon evaluation of the await expression.\n\nConsider setting yourself some breakpoints before and after await keywords and stepping through the code in the AsyncChef. This will give you a much better understanding of how the async code flows.\n\n\n#### Summary\nC# 5.0 async and await make code such as the following very easy to write. Syntactically it is very similar to synchronous code. This flattens the learning curve tremendously for people wanting to start learning and doing things asynchronously. The benefits are huge in many cases. Most noticeably when you are doing things analogous to watching a kettle boil. \n\n```language-csharp\npublic async Task<bool> IsWordOnPage(string url, string word)\n{\n    using (var client = new WebClient()) // No troubles with the using scope\n    {\n        string page = string.Empty;\n\n        try // Exception handling just like you're used to\n        {\n        \t// No messy callbacks or marshalling await evaluates here just \n            // like any other expression when the download is done\n            page = await client.DownloadStringTaskAsync(url);\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(e);\n        }\n        \n        return page.Contains(word); // Anyone awaiting this will receive a bool when complete\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\nI hope my chefs have helped to explain async in a tangible way. If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them in the comments below. Next time you see a kettle boiling in your applications, go on, make it async. What are you awaiting<sup>3</sup> for?\n\n---\n<small><sup>1</sup> A console application has no SynchronizationContext so the rest of the async method will fire using the default scheduler on a thread pool thread. This means that the continuation will probably fire on another thread. I have used a clever library called [Nito.AsyncEx](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nito.AsyncEx) to create a SyncContext for the console app and force a single thread.</small>\n\n<small><sup>2</sup> This does not actually have to be a Task. All something needs to be awaitable is a method GetAwaiter() which returns a class implementing INotifyCompletion.</small>\n\n<small><sup>3</sup> I'm sorry, but I had to.</small>","html":"<p>For the past few weeks I have been researching async in C# 5.0 and I have a few things I would like to share. </p>\n\n<p>Recently I read a book by Alex Davies <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Async-C-5-0-Alex-Davies/dp/1449337163\">Async in C# 5.0</a>.

When the long running work is finished, there is magic that happens under the covers to ensure that your code resumes on the right thread.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"whatmagicisthis\">What magic is this?</h4>\n\n<p>First off, async and await are a C# language feature. The CLR knows nothing about it. This means that everything involved in getting your asynchronous code to look, feel and behave like synchronous code is happening in the compiler. There is no functionality in the CLR to pause and resume a method so this is achieved by creating a state machine. In simple cases the state machine magic is easy to understand, but for more complex examples like nesting or using statements it is truly magical. There is a fantastic <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDays/Techdays-2014-the-Netherlands/Async-programming-deep-dive\">talk</a> by Bart De Smet explaining how this works in detail.</p>\n\n<p>Very basically your method is chopped up into as many parts as you have await statements, plus one. A state machine tracks which part is to be executed next. Every time an await keyword is hit a continuation is registered to execute the next part of your method when the previous part is complete.</p>\n\n<p>Each time an await expression is hit in your async methods a number of actions are preformed:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A check is done to see if the Task you are awaiting is already complete. <br />\n<ul><li>If it is complete the method will continue synchronously.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The current SynchronizationContext is captured.  </li>\n<li>Everything required to continue the method is bundled into an object and stored on the heap.  </li>\n<li>A continuation is registered on completion of the awaited Task<sup>2</sup> to continue the state machine.  </li>\n<li>The tread is released and control is returned to the calling method.  </li>\n<li>When the awaited Task is complete the state machine is invoked again to continue the method.  </li>\n<li>If the SynchronizationContext captured in 2. is not null it is used to ensure that the continuation is marshalled onto the original thread. If it is null the current task scheduler is used. This is probably the default so the remainder of your method will execute on a thread pool thread.  </li>\n<li>The result of the Task is coerced. If it is a Task<T> the await expression will return a result of T if no exceptions were thrown.  </li>\n<li>If any exceptions were thrown during execution the first will be coerced and re-thrown upon evaluation of the await expression.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Consider setting yourself some breakpoints before and after await keywords and stepping through the code in the AsyncChef. This will give you a much better understanding of how the async code flows.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n\n<p>C# 5.0 async and await make code such as the following very easy to write. Syntactically it is very similar to synchronous code. This flattens the learning curve tremendously for people wanting to start learning and doing things asynchronously. The benefits are huge in many cases. Most noticeably when you are doing things analogous to watching a kettle boil. </p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-csharp\">public async Task&lt;bool&gt; IsWordOnPage(string url, string word)  \n{\n    using (var client = new WebClient()) // No troubles with the using scope\n    {\n        string page = string.Empty;\n\n        try // Exception handling just like you're used to\n        {\n            // No messy callbacks or marshalling await evaluates here just \n            // like any other expression when the download is done\n            page = await client.DownloadStringTaskAsync(url);\n        }\n        catch (Exception e)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(e);\n        }\n\n        return page.Contains(word); // Anyone awaiting this will receive a bool when complete\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I hope my chefs have helped to explain async in a tangible way. If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them in the comments below. Next time you see a kettle boiling in your applications, go on, make it async. What are you awaiting<sup>3</sup> for?</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><small><sup>1</sup> A console application has no SynchronizationContext so the rest of the async method will fire using the default scheduler on a thread pool thread. This means that the continuation will probably fire on another thread. I have used a clever library called <a href=\"http://www.nuget.org/packages/Nito.AsyncEx\">Nito.AsyncEx</a> to create a SyncContext for the console app and force a single thread.</small></p>\n\n<p><small><sup>2</sup> This does not actually have to be a Task. All something needs to be awaitable is a method GetAwaiter() which returns a class implementing INotifyCompletion.</small></p>\n\n<p><small><sup>3</sup> I'm sorry, but I had to.</small></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1404418391063,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1407788295643,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1407788160000,"published_by":1},{"id":3,"uuid":"95db9be7-2771-43b5-baa1-740ec444415a","title":"hg (Mercurial) forget files matched in .hgignore","slug":"hg-mercurial-forget-files-matched-in-hgignore","markdown":"In my world a lot of source controlling gets done using [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/).

Your folder should now look something like this.\n\n![Ghost folder](/content/images/2014/Jul/Ghost-folder.png)\n\nNext copy and rename the *config.example.js* file to *config.js*. Now fire up the new config in your favourite editor. For now we are only worried about the production section. You need to change the *url* to `http://{yoursite}.azurewebsites.net` where the text `{yoursite}` is replaced by the name of your site. Also the *port* must be changed to `process.env.PORT`.
